# UnORG-Data-Science-Supply-Chain

UNORG is a fast-growing B2B grocery delivery platform aiming to revolutionize the supply chain by integrating data-driven intelligence with logistics operations. This project addresses core challenges in customer order prediction, SKU-level demand forecasting, and inventory planning over a 14-day horizon.

🔍 **Problem Statement**


The goal is to build a predictive system to:

<u>Order Identification:</u>  Predict the probability of each customer placing an order daily for the next 14 days.

Order Composition & Quantity:  Forecast the SKUs and quantities each customer is likely to order.

Inventory Planning:  Aggregate demand to generate an optimized inventory plan for all SKUs over the next two weeks.



🛠️ **Key Deliverables**


Customer Order Prediction Model:  Classifies the daily order likelihood per customer.

SKU-Level Demand Forecasting:  Predicts what items and how much of each item customers will order.

Inventory Planning Engine:  Provides a consolidated inventory stocking plan using the demand forecast.



🎯 **Objectives & Expected Outcomes**
Improve demand predictability across diverse customer segments (e.g., dhabas, restaurants, stores).

Reduce stockouts and overstocking, minimizing waste.

Enhance fulfillment SLAs and customer satisfaction through timely deliveries.



🧠 **Technical Highlights**


Time-series modeling and supervised learning techniques

Handling sparse and seasonal B2B order data

Feature engineering for customer behavior and SKU trends

Optimization logic for inventory aggregation and stocking decisions



🚀 **Future Scope**


Real-time deployment pipeline using cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP)

Dynamic adjustment to demand shocks (festivals, weekends, etc.)

Expansion to cold-chain or perishable categories
